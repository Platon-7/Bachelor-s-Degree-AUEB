# Artificial Intelligence

This course is from the 3rd year of my studies and without a doubt, my favorite so far. Artificial Intelligence seems to be the perfect combination of programming and
math. It requires a deep theoretical background, but it also contributes actively with bots like Chat-GPT proving that AI is here to stay. The course had two projects,
one more theoretical mostly trying to explain the ability of AI to solve problems, and one classification project that was separating positive and negative movie reviews.
The programming language according to the professor was our choice, and we went with Java because it was the most familiar language to all of us at the time. After all is said 
and done, we think that Python might have been a better choice but Java was a decent choice and worked out fine under the circumstances.

## Syllabus
